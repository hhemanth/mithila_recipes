    1. I have used green moong, black chickpeas and garbanzo beans as only these three pulses were available at home. You can also add rajma and any other pulses available at home, but donâ€™t add more pulses you can limit it to 5.
    2. Soak rice, pulses and methi seeds overnight after washing them throughly. ( I have used methi seeds though we are not fermenting the batter as it gives good taste and is good for health )
    3. Just before you grind add thin poha and leave it for 20 mins in the morning. You can also ferment the dosa by adding 1/4 th cup of urad dal along with pulses.
    4. Now, grind all the soaked ingredients along with spinach, green chillies, ginger, hing and cumin seeds. (You can add more spinach leaves depending on the quantity of soaked ingredients ). Red chillies can be used instead of green chillies. As an alternate instead of spinach you may also use chopped methi leaves for this dosa.
    5. Grind it to the consistency of the regular dosa batter and keep it little coarse and not too coarse.
    6. Add salt to the batter and start to aerate the batter by mixing it continuously for 5 to 10 mins in one direction. By this our dosa will be more light and crispy.
    7. Keep the tawa or skillet for heating and prepare dosa as we do the regular urad dal dosa. Cover and cook the dosa on one side as this is not a fermented dosa, it may turn hard after sometime.
    8. Serve hot with your favourite chutney or sabji. I have used oil for preparing dosa, you can use ghee also.
