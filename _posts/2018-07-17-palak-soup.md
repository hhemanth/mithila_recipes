    1. Clean spinach or palak and chop them finely.
    2. In a deep pan add 1 tsp of oil ( you can take olive oil or even butter also I have taken normal refined oil )
    3. When oil is hot, add bay leaf, garlic cloves and fry them without burning them.
    4. Then add onion and fry them till they are soft or for around 3 to 4 mins in medium flame.
    5. Now add palak and fry them, since palak is more in water content it shrinks quickly or reduces in volume.
    6. Now add around 2 cups of water or vegetable stock and allow it to cook.
    7. Let it boil for around 5 to 7 minutes in medium flame or till palak is cooked.
    8. After its boiled, add salt and pepper and allow it to cool.
    9. When it is cooled grind the mixture, if you find it thick you can add more water or vegetable stock.
    10. After grinding strain the mixture. Again put it in a pan and let it come to a single boil.
    11. Check for salt and pepper at this time, if you are serving for kids you can add butter. If the soup is too thin you can add cornflour slurry to give it a thick consistency.
    12. Serve palak soup and enjoy it piping hot.

Monsoons have started and all of us want to eat something hot when it is raining to enjoy the rains. 

We tend to eat deep fried when it is raining or when it is cold but I prefer soups instead of fried snacks. This helps to maintain our health and also warms up our body from inside. 

You can enjoy these soups when you are dieting as well. When you prepare these soups on regular basis it is better to skip butter, fresh cream and corn flour for health reasons. I prepare Tomato soup. Palak soup, clear vegetable soup, sweet pumpkin soup on a regular basis. I keep it simple and add very little seasoning.
 
A bowl of piping hot soup is so comforting when it is raining or cold that you will ask for more. Kids also enjoy this soup and palak soup is a great option for us to consume green leafy vegetable. My husband’s favourite is tomato soup and mine is palak soup. 

I think everyone is aware of the health benefits of spinach or palak. I have mentioned about this in my earlier post [Palak Paneer](https://www.mithilaas.com/sabji/2018/03/05/palak-paneer/)
. Now let’s check the recipe.
