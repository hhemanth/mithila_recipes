    1. Take a heavy bottom pan and put all the ingredients in it and mix it properly to ensure that there are no lumps formed.(This should be done when the flame is off)
    2. Now switch on the gas and keep the flame in low  and keep stirring .
    3. Meanwhile grease a plate with ghee and keep it ready to take the burfi mixture .
    4. Keep stirring the mixture in a low flame till it forms a dough and starts to leave the pan.
    5. As the mixture starts to leave the sides of pan take it out on to a greased plate and allow it to cool.(if you cannot come to know exactly when the burfi is done ,wet your fingers a bit and take little amount of mixture and roll it like ladoo if it is not sticking to your hands and the shape is maintained then this is the exact time to take the burfi mixture out of the pan ,this procedure can be followed for all burfi’s)
    6. When the mixture is little warm mark the shape of burfi using a sharp knife as it becomes difficult to cut if it gets completely cooled as it becomes hard.(you can give burfis shape of your choice )
    7. Allow it cool and then enjoy the tasty treat (do not forget it to share it with your family and friends )
