      1. First soak saunf and sugar in 3 tbsp of water for 2 to 3 hours ( here i have used rock sugar also called as diamond sakkare in kannada, you can also use normal sugar )
      2. When the sugar melts, blend saunf and sugar mixture with the water used for soaking (use small mixer jar for blending ).
      3. Take a mocktail glass or a mason jar and add ice cubes, strain the blended mixture to the glass.
      4. It will have a strong saunf flavour so you can add more water depending on your taste ( don’t add more water than required as it will take away the flavour of saunf )
      5. This sharbat is a natural internal body cooler and also is good for digestion.
