    directions_markdown: |-
      1. Soak green moong in water for 6 to 7 hours
      2. After moong is soaked drain the water completely using a strainer ( it is very important to drain the water completely from moong otherwise it becomes difficult for frying )
      3. In a mixer jar add drained moong dal, 2 green chillies and ginger ,blend them without using any water ( better way is to blend the ingredients using small jar in two batches grind them to a coarse mixture don’t grind them smooth )
      4. Keep oil for frying , and then add salt to the coarse moong mixture and mix it properly.
      5. Take a small quantity of coarse moong mixture and give a shape of small lemon size ball and put them in hot oil.
      6. Oil should be hot enough when we add the moong balls. Frying is the most important part , fry the moong balls in medium flame till they are  semi crispy  ,don’t fry them till they are too crispy then they will not absorb manchurian sauce and don’t fry them soft then they become soggy after adding them to sauce. So fry them carefully in medium flame to semi crispy moong balls and they need to be cooked from inside also .
      7. Don’t add any gram flour or rice flour to coarse moong  mixture and also don’t add hot oil or baking soda to mixture .
      8. After they are turned semi crispy and golden brown in colour remove them an place them on kitchen towel tissues for about 30 seconds. Transfer them to a strainer to strain excess oil.
      9. Now the moong balls are ready to go to manchurian sauce

        **To prepare manchurian sauce:**

      1. In a pan add 1 tbsp oil and allow it become hot ( chinese cuisine is always prepared on a high flame and in a deep wok , if wok is not available you can use deep kadai i have used a non stick kadai here )
      2. Keep the flame high add garlic , green chillies and then onion. ( since the flame will be high there are chances of veggies getting burnt so be careful )
      3. When the veggies are  getting ready let’s make corn flour mixture ready
      4. In a small bowl add corn flour and water to make a slurry to this add schezwan sauce ,soya sauce, green chilli  sauce, tomato ketchup  and salt and mix it properly ( i have added the sauces to corn flour slurry itself as it becomes easier and there will no chances of any sauce getting overcooked , keep an check on salt as all the sauces contains salt )
      5. Now when the veggies are done add the cornflour and sauces slurry and put the flame to sim till the sauce becomes thick ( remember to mix the cornflour  slurry with spoon before adding it to the veggie mixture )
      6. After the sauces are cooked keep the flame high add the fried moong balls and coriander sprigs and toss them up for 3 to 4 mins or till the moong balls absorb sauce (this step takes a little long time then gobhi manchurian )
      7. Now serve the hot and spicy green moong manchurian with ketchup .

        **Tips:**

      1. You can always keep the manchurian sauce and moong balls ready and toss them up quickly when guests arrive and serve them hot.
      2. Frying moong balls is very important step and follow the instructions carefully, otherwise manchurian becomes hard.
