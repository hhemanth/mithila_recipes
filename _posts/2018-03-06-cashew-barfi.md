    1. Choosing a good quality of kaju is very important as it enhances the taste of burfi 
    2. Now grind 1 cup of kaju in a mixer to a coarse powder ( Dont grind it for a long time as kaju will start to release oil )
    3. Sieve the kaju mixture so that when we add kaju to sugar syrup it will not form lumps 
    4. In a deep broad pan add sugar and water ,keep the flame in high till the sugar dissolves and then simmer it till you get one string consistency.
    5. As soon as the sugar syrup is ready keep the flame in sim and add the kaju powder and keep stirring so it ensures no lumps are formed.
    6. After 5 mins when see the mixture is about to leave the pan add 1 tbsp to ghee to it,when you add the ghee the mixture becomes smooth and will leave the sides of the pan quickly.
    7. Take the mixture in a plate greased with ghee and allow it to cool for sometime and then cut it into desired shapes and sizes.
    8. Enjoy this super easy and tasty indian sweet
    
    **Tips:**
    1. To get sugar syrup of single thread consistency take water exactly half the amount of sugar taken, this ensures that you get a perfect single thread sugar syrup in 5 mins
    2. I have skipped cardamom powder here to maintain the original taste of kaju you can always do it according to your taste.
    3. I have taken the kaju mixture directly on a greased plate and cut it ,you can always take the mixture dough and roll it as chapati using a rolling pin and then cut it.
