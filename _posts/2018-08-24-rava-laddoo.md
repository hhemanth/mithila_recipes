    1. In a heavy bottom pan, add ghee, oil and allow it to heat. I have used oil as using oil along with ghee in sweets will make the sweet soft. This is same in cakes also if we use oil instead of butter, it makes the cakes spongy and moist.
    2. When the ghee and oil mixture is hot add chopped cashew nuts and fry them for 10 secs and then add raisins. When the raisins puff up, add rava and fry it in a low flame else it will burn. Here I have used chiroti rava or small grain rava as it is most suitable for rava ladoo.
    3. Fry rava for 5 to 7 mins in low flame till the raw smell is no longer there.
    4. Add sugar, dry coconut, cardamom powder and fry for 2 mins. Donâ€™t fry for long time as the sugar will start to melt and giving proper shape to the laddoo becomes difficult. I have used small granulated sugar here.
    5. Now add milk slowly and mix it. Switch off the flame. Close the lid of the pan and allow the mixture to cool for 5 mins. By this time our sugar would have  melted a little and mixed properly with rava.
    6. After 5 mins, open the pan lid and start preparing laddoo by taking a little quantity at a time. If you feel the mixture is becoming dry then you can add little milk. Size of ladoo is your choice.
    7. Delicious rava ladoo is ready to be served.
