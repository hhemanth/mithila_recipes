    1. Chop green chillies into small pieces and soak tamarind in water for 20 mins.
    2. Grate fresh coconut. 
    3. In a small pan add ½ tbsp of oil, then add chopped green chillies, 5 curry leaves, ginger and finely chopped coriander and fry them till they are roasted.( don’t add a whole green chilly it will splutter and may burn your skin)
    4. In a mixer jar add fried gram and the roasted ingredients and churn them to a fine powder.
    5. Now add grated coconut, tamarind, salt and sugar to the same jar.
    6. Grind them to a smooth paste using water. (Check that the quantity of salt is right, Sugar is optional)
    7. Take the chutney in a serving bowl.
    8. In a small tadka pan add the remaining oil and when it is hot add mustard seeds, 5 curry leaves, pinch of hing and one red chilly. When they are roasted add the tadka to chutney. ( I have added a pinch of hing, you can  skip it if you don’t like the smell and taste of hing. Red chilly is also optional, in its place you can also use ½ tsp of urad dal)
    9. Here I have served coconut chutney with adai dosa so I have kept chutney a bit thick. When you are serving with Idly, chutney should be little thin, so that you can dip hot Idly in chutney and enjoy. ( I will be uploading how to make a perfect crispy adai dosa shortly)

Easy to prepare and tasty to eat coconut chutney is Idly, Dosa and Vada's best friend. They are inseparable. We can eat idly without sambar but not without chutney.

This recipe is mine and my husband's personal favourite. Hot idly with butter and chutney served is just yummm.
