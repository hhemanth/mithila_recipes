Raw mango pickles are a treasure of good health. They contain an acid which helps to ease digestion and control constipation. They are highly beneficial in treating scruvy, prevents dehydration, treats Gastro-Intestinal disorders and also liver disorders.

A recent study shows that one unripe mango yields as much  Vitamin-C as 35 apples, 18 bananas, 9 lemons and 3 oranges.

An Indian Meal is incomplete without pickles. These pickles can also be eaten with Idly, Dosa, Roti, Rice and Curd Rice. Pickles can also be made with lemon, mix vegetables and the list goes on.

There is one point which we have to remember while making pickles, the vessels which we use should be completely dry and also our hands should be dry.

I have made pickles using two raw mangoes and the measurements I have given is  according to that, you can increase the quantity when you are making larger quantity.
