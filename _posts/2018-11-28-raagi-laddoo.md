    1. Grind almonds to a coarse powder in a mixer.
    2. Powder jaggery and keep it aside ( I have used around 3/4 th cup of jaggery powder but you can also use less, depending on your taste)
    3. Finely chop cashews.
    4. Now in a heavy bottom pan add 1 tbsp of ghee and roast cashews and raisins, keep it aside.
    5. To the leftover ghee add ragi flour and roast the flour in a low flame till all the raw smell disappears. It takes around 10 to 15 mins. When the ragi flour starts to release a good aroma add  coarsely ground almonds and roast the ragi flour and almond powder for 5 more mins. Do the roasting in a low flame to avoid burning.
    6. After roasting, transfer the mixture to a big bowl and allow it to cool for 3 to 4 mins.
    7. Melt half cup ghee.
    8. Add  jaggery powder to the flour mixture and mix it properly.
    9. Now add melted ghee to the jaggery powder and flour mixture. Mix it using a spoon.
    10. When the ghee cools, add cardamom powder, roasted cashews and raisins. Mix everything properly using your hands ( see to it that there are large chunks of jaggery )
    11. Give them the shape of laddu.( grease your hands with ghee before shaping the laddus )
    12. Healthy and tasty ragi laddu are ready to be served
