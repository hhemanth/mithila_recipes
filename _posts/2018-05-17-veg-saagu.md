    1. Chop all the vegetables, into small pieces. I have taken quarter cup of each vegetable, you can increase or decrease the amount of vegetable according to your needs. You can also use other veggies like capsicum, boiled green moong, boiled double beans, knol khol. It depends on your choice,  what veggies to use.
    2. In a pan, add oil and heat it. When  oil is hot add mustard seeds, after they splutter add hing, curry leaves and onion.
    3. Fry onion in low to medium flame till they turn soft, now add all the vegetables chopped.
    4. Add water and salt, allow the vegetables to cook, keep the flame in low only.
    5. Meanwhile, grind all the masala items coconut, pudina, coriander, one small chopped onion, fried gram, jeera, green chillies,  pepper corns ,ginger to a fine paste using required amount of water.( I have not added garlic, you can always add 3 to 4 cloves of garlic for grinding)
    6. Later, when the veggies are half cooked, add the ground paste and allow it to cook again for 10 to 15 mins or till the veggies are completely cooked. 
    7. Check for salt at this point and add if required.
    8. Now, delicious vegetable saagu is ready to be served with hot poori or set dosa. Enjoy this with your family.

A South Indian style vegetable saagu or gravy goes well with poori, chapathi, roti or even with hot rice. This is served along with set dosa in many hotels here in south. Easy to prepare and very healthy side dish which will be relished by everyone. You can use vegetables of your choice or what your family likes. 

I remember when I was young my mother used to prepare this on sundays. This tastes awesome along with hot and fluffy poori. I would eat some 2 to 3 extra poori for breakfast and I would demand the same even for lunch also. My mother would never say no as she knew that my demand was for healthy food and not junk. What more can we ask  than, a sunday enjoying a good breakfast and good lunch along with family.
 
Okay, now i have written a lot so let’s shift towards the recipe. By the way there are many versions of vegetable saagu, each and every household has their own recipe and this is my mother’s recipe, I am very sure you will like it.
