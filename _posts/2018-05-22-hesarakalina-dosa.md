A very healthy breakfast recipe which can be consumed by people of all ages. Kids sometimes refuse to eat sprouts directly, not only kids even for adults, it becomes boring to eat sprouts. By using sprouts we can make varieties of dishes, which will be liked by your family members.

If I start writing health benefits of sprouts elaborately, then it will go to pages. So I will keep it short.

Health benefits of sprouts, include the ability to improve digestive process, boost  metabolism, increase enzymatic activity throughout the body, prevent anaemia, aids weight loss, lower cholesterol, reduce blood pressure, helps in proper growth of infants, protects against cancer, boost skin health, improves vision, support the immune system.

Sprouts should be consumed daily to get its health benefits, you can give this to kids daily so that it enables their proper growth. It is a very good source of proteins for vegetarians and vegans. It is my suggestion to  include sprouts in your diet daily to maintain health.

It is simple to make sprouts at home, I will publish the recipe soon.
