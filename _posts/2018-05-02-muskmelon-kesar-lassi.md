    1. Soak saffron in 1 tbsp of milk.
    2. In a blender jar or juicer, add cut muskmelon pieces and sugar. ( you can also skip sugar, if muskmelon is too sweet. Since the one i used was less sweet i have used sugar, you can also replace it with honey)
    3. Blend this till muskmelon is reduced to puree, now add curd and saffron strands and blend it till smooth. ( you can add more curd depending on how thick you like your lassi)
    4. Now in a serving glass add few ice cubes, muskmelon lassi and top it up with fresh cream and garnish it with few strands of saffron.
    5. Muskmelon kesar lassi is ready to be served.
