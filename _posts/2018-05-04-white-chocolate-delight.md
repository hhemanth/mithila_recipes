    Tip - Cooking is always experimenting and enjoying the time we spend in kitchen. As i have mentioned earlier you can replace white chocolate with dark or milk chocolate. I have used amul fresh cream, you can try to replace it with condensed milk. You can even use fresh coconut also. By replacing ingredients you can create a new sweet recipe and make your family happy.
