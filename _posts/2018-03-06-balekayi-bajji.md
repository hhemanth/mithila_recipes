    1. Clean the raw banana and cut it into thin slices and the length can be kept as per your choice.
    2. Keep the oil for for becoming hot
    3. In a bowl add gram flour , rice flour, red chilly powder, hing and salt and mix it.
    4. Start adding water little at a time to avoid lumps and make a smooth batter( the consistency should be of dosa batter)
    5. Now add 1 to 2 tbsp of hot oil in batter and mix it properly ( I have used hot oil instead of cooking soda , by adding hot oil the bajjis will absorb a bit more oil than usual but the taste will be very good )
    6. Now dip the sliced raw banana in the batter and fry it in hot oil.
    7. When the bajjis turn golden brown remove it on the kitchen towel and serve hot .
    8. You can enjoy these bajjis with any sauce , chutney or just like that .
