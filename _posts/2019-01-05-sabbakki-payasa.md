    1. Wash Sabudana in fresh water 
    2. Place the washed Sabudana in a container, add water so that the Sabudana is just covered, not more not less. Allow them to get soaked for for 2 to 3 hours.
    2. In a heavy bottom pan, add milk and allow it to boil.
    3. When milk starts to boil, add soaked Sabudana and allow it to cook in low flame.
    4. Keep stirring once in a while to avoid milk getting burnt at the bottom of pan.
    5. Keep the flame low and when sabudana is almost cooked add sugar and condensed milk.
    6. Meanwhile in a small pan add ghee and roast cashews and raisins.
    7. Let the kheer cook in low flame for 10 more minutes after adding sugar and condensed milk. Milk gets thickened and kheer becomes rich and creamy.
    8. Add cardamom powder and roasted dry fruits to kheer.
    9. Switch off the flame and sabudana kheer is ready to be served.
    10. You can serve this hot or you can also refrigerate and serve chilled. sabudana absorbs milk as it gets cooler, so you can add milk to get the right consistency before serving.
