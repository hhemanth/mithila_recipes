Thovve is a combination of vegetables and lentils. This can be made with toor dal or moong dal with or without vegetable also. Thovve or dal has less oil and is very healthy. It is little liquidy and goes well with hot rice and also with chapathi.

Ridge gourd has many health benefits. It reduces hyperacidity, good for diabetics, low in calories and cholesterol, helps to get rid of constipation, high in vitamin C, and a good source of dietary fibre, riboflavin, thiamin, zinc, iron, manganese and magnesium. It also helps in detoxing and preventing acne.

Here i have used toor dal or split pigeon peas, which is a good source of protein, controls cholesterol and improves digestion.

Thovve is a healthy packed meal and can be consumed from small children till old age people as it is mildly flavoured with less oil, less spice.
