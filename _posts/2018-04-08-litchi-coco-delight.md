      1. Add tender coconut malai and blend it for 30 secs in a blender jar or juicer.
      2. Add rest of the ingredients and blend it ( I have used readymade litchi juice you can also use fresh litchi juice )
      3. Mocktail is ready to be served ( you can also strain it sometimes coconut malai would not have blended properly )
