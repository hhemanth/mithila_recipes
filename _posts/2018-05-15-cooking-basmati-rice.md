  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Wash and soak rice for 10 mins using required amount of water.( soaking is very important as it head starts the cooking in rice)
    2. Strain the rice and put it in cooker and add water, salt and oil.( The amount of water to take while making rice in cooker is very important, to make rice non sticky and fluffy.)
    3. Close the lid and give 2 whistles in medium to high flame ( this is standard which i have mentioned but it also depends on the flame of gas and also the litre of cooker. So please check the rice after 2 whistles and then you can decide. But generally gets cooked in 2 whistles)
    4. After the steam is released completely open the cooker and allow the rice to cool for 10 mins.
    5. Serve rice after it is cooled for 10 mins to get more fluffier rice, you can also use it for jeera rice, pulao, fried rice and biryani.

    Tip - As the rice is aged more, it gets more fluffier and non sticky when it is cooked. So choose a good quality and aged rice.
