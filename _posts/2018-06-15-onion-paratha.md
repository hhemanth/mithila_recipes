    1. In a bowl add wheat flour, salt, oil and knead the dough as we do for all the other paratha. The dough should be a little stiff than the dough we knead for roti or phulka.
    2. Let the dough rest for 10 to 15 minutes.
    3. In a pan add oil, and then finely chopped onions and saute them for 1 to 2 mins. Don’t let the onions turn brown.
    4. Add salt, red chilly powder, coriander powder, garam masala, ajwain, coriander powder and mix it. Switch off the stove and allow it to cool.
    5. Now start rolling small roti, keep the stuffing close it and roll it into a small paratha.
    6. Shallow fry them using ghee or oil on both the sides till they get brown spots.
    7. Onion paratha is ready to be served.

I always prepare different kinds of paratha at home like aloo paratha, paneer paratha, methi aloo paratha, gobhi paratha, cheese paratha, onion paratha and many more. 

So I thought I have to start sharing all the paratha recipes one by one from my kitchen. Very easy to prepare and healthy onion paratha can be had for breakfast and dinner also.
