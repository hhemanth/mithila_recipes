    1. Wash and soak the rice for around 15 minutes.
    2. In a pressure cooker add oil and ghee and allow it to become hot.
    3. When oil and ghee is hot add cloves and black pepper and fry them ( i have only added cloves and black pepper as I don’t like too much of masala in my peas pulao, You can also add an inch of cinnamon and  green cardamom).
    4. Then add frozen green peas and fry for 3 minutes ( i have used frozen green peas, fresh peas can also be used then you need to fry them around 5 to 7 minutes.
    5. Drain the water from rice completely using a strainer and add it to cooker (This is important as extra water in rice can make it mushy).
    6. Fry the rice for around 5 minutes or till the water in the rice grains are evaporated.
    7. Now add water and salt ( For a fluffy and non sticky pulao quantity of water is very important while preparing in cooker. For 1 measure of rice 1 ¼ th cup water has to be taken)
    8. Soon after water starts to boil close the cooker lid and let it cook for 2 whistles in high flame.
    9. Open the lid of cooker after the steam is released completely .
    10. Hot peas pulao is ready to be served with gravy of your choice.
    11. You can also add cashews it is optional.
    12. I will write a detailed text on why we need to soak rice , how to cook basmati rice in different methods very soon.

A very easy rice recipe and can be prepared in half an hour with little effort. You can serve this with your favourite gravy. With a few ingredients it gets prepared fast and tastes awesome. I have used basmati rice to prepare pulao, You can use normal rice too .
Basmati rice contains carbohydrates, protein, less fat, fiber, vitamins and minerals. Compared with normal rice, basmati rice is low in calories. It has good aroma and great nutritional value.
Here i have used pressure cooker to make this pulao.


I will be publishing a separate recipe on how to cook basmati rice in open pot, closed pot and pressure cooker soon.
