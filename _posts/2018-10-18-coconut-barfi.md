    1. In a pan add freshly grated coconut and sugar, and mix it.
    2. Keep the flame low and keep mixing coconut and sugar. After 5 secs add milk and continue stirring ( while grating the coconut, if there are big chunks or pieces of coconut, you can churn it once in mixer. I have added milk, you can always add water also but milk gives more taste )
    3. keep on stirring as sugar starts to melt.
    4. At one point sugar and coconut combines with each other and forms a dough like form. At this point add 1 tsp of ghee. Don’t over cook as kobbari mithai will break off before you can mould them to pieces.
    5. Pour the mixture on a greased plate and allow it to cool for 5 mins.
    6. Cut it in square shape and kobbari Mithai is ready to serve.
